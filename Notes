Top Class ->  JFrame extension , has main
main creates new top class and setting to visible
new top class constructor builds a new frame and packs it to TopClass. can't resize the gamescreen, sets title, sets size, and makes sure you can close out of it.


PlayGameScreen --> setting panel width, height. set focusable = true. creating a buffer. create dog and set width and height, x, y.
Setting up the initial obstacles with width height x y. Setting up timer with delay and starting the timer ----

----> starting the timer calls actionPerformed function, which resets the locations for all obstacles and calls paint function. The timer will repeatedly call
the actionPerformed function with a given interval.Function call only stops when you call stop timer.

The paint function calls the graphics object to draw the dog and the obstacle. 


How Initobstacles works:

1. Create 2D integer array to store x y location.
2. Create 1D integer array to store height.
3. Create arrayList of obstacle. ArrayList supports add, remove and get functions.
4. For each element in the integer x y 2d array loop
      get x y value
      randomly pick one height from height array
      create new obstacle with above x y and height 
      width is fixed to 150
      add the above created obstacle to obstacleArrayList
   
   End Loop
   
updateListobstaclesRighttoLeft:

1. For each obstacle in ArrayList
      get obstacle
      if obstacle x position is above zero
         obstacle x position = current position - 10
      else
         remove obstacle
         call init obstacle to add new obstacles
   End Loop
