How to run the Coco's Adventure:

1. Click the run button.

2. When the game screen comes up, you will see a dog on the left of the screen. Click the space bar to keep the dog
elevated. If you stop pressing the space bar, the dog will move downwards until it hits the ground, and the game will 
be over.

3. Using the space bar, avoid hitting the brown log rectangles at the bottom of the screen and the blue rain 
rectangles at the top of the screen.

Important Notes:

 - The score at the bottom of the screen, located against the black rectangle, will keep track of how many logs you 
   pass. Try to get a large score!

 - If at any time, you allow the dog to touch the ground (the black rectangle) or touch the rain 
   or log rectangles, a large message will pop up on the screen saying "game over." You cannot resume your progress
   when the message pops up.

Good luck and have fun playing!
