Top Class ->  JFrame extension , has main
main creates new top class and setting to visible
new top class constructor builds a new frame and packs it to TopClass. can't resize the gamescreen, sets title, sets size, and makes sure you can close out of it.


PlayGameScreen --> setting panel width, height. set focusable = true. creating a buffer. create dog and set width and height, x, y.
Setting up the initial logs with width height x y. Setting up timer with delay and starting the timer ----

----> starting the timer calls actionPerformed function, which resets the locations for all logs and calls paint function. The timer will repeatedly call
the actionPerformed function with a given interval.Function call only stops when you call stop timer.

The paint function calls the graphics object to draw the dog and the log. 


How InitLogs works:

1. Create 2D integer array to store x y location.
2. Create 1D integer array to store height.
3. Create arrayList of Log. ArrayList supports add, remove and get functions.
4. For each element in the integer x y 2d array loop
      get x y value
      randomly pick one height from height array
      create new log with above x y and height 
      width is fixed to 150
      add the above created log to LogArrayList
   
   End Loop
   
updateListLogsRighttoLeft:

1. For each log in ArrayList
      get Log
      if log x position is above zero
         log x position = current position - 10
      else
         remove log
         call init log to add new logs
   End Loop
